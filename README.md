# Adblocking Solutions

Tips and tricks I have learned for blocking advertisements and trackers on the internet.

This list is for educational purposes only, and I take no responsibility for situations these tools may put you in. Feel free to submit PRs to add your own information or fork this repo.

# Background

Online advertisements have become an unfortunate necessity in today's online ecosystem. Providing services and hosting content is not free, so something needs to pay for it. It is unreasonable to expect each user to pay for each website or service they use on a daily basis. In 2021, digital advertising spending reached $521,000,000,000 and is projected to pass 876 billion dollars in 2026. In 2020, the internet was the largest medium for advertisements accounting for 51% of total media ad spend.<sup>[1](https://www.statista.com/statistics/237974/online-advertising-spending-worldwide/)</sup> With the industry only growing, online advertising will remain an important part of the internet.

## Why block ads?

While online advertisements are an important backbone of the internet, there are some reasons why one may choose to block them.

- Targeted Advertisements
- Avoiding deception
- General annoyances

# Web Browsers

Before we can discuss blocking ads on the internet we must briefly mention your choice of browser. Most browsers today are a fork of Chromium. These browsers include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Brave, and many more. These browsers currently support adblocking, but the future of this support is unclear with Google introduction of Manifest v3. This change can affect how browsers support adblocking in the future. <sup>[2](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-chrome-manifest-v3-ad-blocker-extension-api/)</sup>

## Recommended Browser

### **[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)**

For now Firefox is my recommendation. Its not perfect<sup>[3](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/sponsor-privacy)</sup>, but is an open source browser with strong community extension support and the tools to strength the privacy and adblocking properties

  Here are some recommendations to improve your firefox experience:

  - Turn off sponsored content
  - Disable pocket
  - Switch search to DuckDuckGo
  - Turn off search suggestions
  - Set Enhanced Tracking Protection to Strict
  - Disable passwords, address, credit cards, autofill, forms saving
  - Disable firefox data collection
  - Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows

## Alternative

### **[Brave](https://brave.com/)**

If you absolutely must use a Chromium browser, I recommend not using Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. It can be argued which is worse for privacy.<sup>[4](https://www.intrust-it.com/edge-vs-chrome-what-is-the-safest-browser/)</sup> I use Brave even through the controversies<sup>[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_(web_browser)#Controversies)</sup> as the product has options to disable unnecessary features and it works better than Firefox on Android.
